Resum√© : ROUGE stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy forGisting Evaluation. It includes measures to auto-matically determine the quality of a summary bycomparing it to other (ideal) summaries created byhumans. The measures count the number of over-lapping units such as n-gram, word sequences, andword pairs between the computer-generated sum-mary to be evaluated and the ideal summaries cre-ated by humans. This paper introduces four differentROUGE measures: ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W,and ROUGE-S included in the ROUGE summariza-tion evaluation package and their evaluations. Threeof them have been used in the Document Under-standing Conference (DUC) 2004, a large-scalesummarization evaluation sponsored by NIST.
