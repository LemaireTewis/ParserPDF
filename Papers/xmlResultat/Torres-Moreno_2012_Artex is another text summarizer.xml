	<abstract>This paper describes Artex, another algorithm for Automatic Text Summarization.In order to rank sentences, a simple inner product is calculated between each sentence, adocument vector (text topic) and a lexical vector (vocabulary used by a sentence). Sum-maries are then generated by assembling the highest ranked sentences. No ruled-basedlinguistic post-processing is necessary in order to obtain summaries. Tests over severaldatasets (coming from Document Understanding Conferences (DUC), Text Analysis Con-ference (TAC), evaluation campaigns, etc.) in French, English and Spanish have shownthat Artex summarizer achieves interesting results</abstract>
