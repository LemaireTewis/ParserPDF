	<abstract>The increased volumes of Arabic sources of data available on the Web has boosted the development of Natural Language Processing(NLP) tools over different tasks and applications. However, to take advantage from a vast amount of these applications, a priorsegmentation task call Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) is needed. In this paper we focus on SBD over Modern Standard Arabic(MSA) by comparing two different approaches based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) using out-of-domain and in-domain trainingdata with only lexical features (represented as character embedding) while conducting two scenarios based on a ConvolutionalNeural Network and a Recurrent Neural Network with attention mechanism architectures. While tuning a big out-of-domain datasetwith a smaller in-domain dataset, improves the performance in general. Our evaluations were based on IWSLT 2017 TED talkstranscripts and showed similarities and differences depending of the SBD method. MSA carries certain complications given itsrich and complex morphology. However, using only lexical features for Arabic SBD is an acceptable option when the source audiosignal is not available and a certain level of language independence needs to be reached.</abstract>
